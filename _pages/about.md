Hello! I am a data science professional with over half a decade of experience in building data science teams and engineering data-driven solutions that serve over half a million users. I currently lead the data team at [BridgeLinx](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bridgelinx), a fast-growing logistics startup, where I work on building scalable data infrastructure and software that helps optimize Pakistan’s trucking industry. Previously, I worked at [Finja](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/finja), a leading fintech company, where I engineered multiple AI/ML products focused on improving access to financing for everyday people. As the first data hire at both companies, I built and scaled their data teams from the ground up. Earlier in my career, I was fortunate to intern at and be mentored by amazing people at [CERN](https://home.cern/), [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/en) (via [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/)), and [Meta Open Source](https://opensource.fb.com/).

I received my BS in Computer Engineering from the University of Engineering & Technology (UET), Lahore, advised by [Dr. Irfan Ullah Chaudhary](https://nps.edu/documents/103424733/107333307/IrfanCV2009+in+PDF.pdf/9f23b384-e296-4c0e-a6f4-08b75a499d27), and an MS in Computer Science from Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), where I worked with [Dr. Ihsan Ayyub Qazi](https://www.ihsanqazi.com/).


<b>Research Interests:</b> I am interested in various aspects of database systems, including data management, visualization, human-database interactions, and data quality. I aim to utilize advances in machine learning to build the next generation of data systems. 


<b>Communities:</b> I enjoy contributing to open-source communities, learning from diverse design principles and coding practices, and incorporating them in my own work. Some of the projects I’ve contributed to include [Ceph](https://ceph.io/en), [Osquery](https://www.osquery.io/), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). From enhancing distributed storage software to improving vulnerability detection, I’ve had the opportunity to improve the security, scalability, and performance of critical systems that are widely used in the industry.


<b>Initiatives:</b>
I’m passionate about creating impactful solutions for challenges unique to developing countries. During my master’s, I co-founded a startup aimed at helping students find living accommodations in different cities, an experience which taught me a lot about entrepreneurship. At Finja, I launched Pakistan’s first [P2P lending platform](https://x.com/SECPakistan/status/1526596678219972609) to empower small businesses and mid-tier investors, and built the country’s first data-driven credit engine for undocumented SMEs. Now at BridgeLinx, I focus on solving challenges faced by truck drivers and logistics workers to boost Pakistan’s economy.
